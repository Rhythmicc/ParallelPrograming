# ParallelPrograming

Our Parallel Programming Course has two projects, `SDNN` and `cholesky`, both of them are aim to optimize the performance of code on `amd02` which has **128 cores with 500G MEM**

## 1. SDNN

Use `sparse matrix`, `openmp` and `avx2` to optimize!

## 2. Cholesky

Just use `openmp` and `Compiler optimization`!
